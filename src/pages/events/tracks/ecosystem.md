The Ecosystem track hosts a mix of talks by selected communities in the Rust ecosystem and exciting new open-source projects:

- a talk by each [unconf](/unconf) group (e.g. Bevy Engine and Rust Embedded Working Group)
- a lightning talk by each of the finalists of the GOSIM Spotlight

Part of the Ecosystem track, the **GOSIM Spotlight** offers early-stage Rust projects a unique opportunity to shine at RustWeek 2025 and present their work. Finalists will receive travel grant to attend the RustWeek conference.

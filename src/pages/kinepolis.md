## Conference rooms

The talks will be held in cinema rooms, which has a couple of amazing features. First, a massive cinema-grade screen will make it easy to follow the talks from anywhere in the room. Second, the seats are some of the most comfortable you'll ever encounter at a conference.

## Socializing

The catering area, called Speys, is a huge space; perfect for eating and socializing, and hosting our sponsor's booths. It allows for 1200 people, which is more than enough for the 800 attendees we hope to welcome. There will seats, tables and power outlets for everyone to talk, code and hang out. Lunch, snacks, and drinks are, of course, included with your ticket.

In a classic case of "Rewrite It In Rust", implementing a novel
algorithm for identifying binding sites in DNA led to a 100x improvement in 
speed. This talk emphasizes on *what* made it easier with Rust compared
to C & C++, which are still in use predominantly in high-performance bioinformatics.

Hi, I'm Martin (or @althonos online)! Originally from Paris, I started my PhD at the [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) in Heidelberg in 2019, in partnership with [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), before moving to the [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/en/) in 2024. Molecular Biologist and Computer Scientist by training, I've been working on high-performance computing on the side of my main research project focusing on the human gut microbiome.

I started writing Rust code in 2017, used it primarily for my MSc thesis project in 2019, and since then I have eagerly followed the evolution of the core language as well as the flourishing ecosystem of libraries. I use Rust for high-performance computing when possible, although I also end up supporting legacy scientific code written in C/C++, and my main language for data analysis or quick prototyping remains Python. 

I am interested in high-performance computing, but also in API design, embedded systems, and more. I'm leading a small programming club at our institute, where we go over various topics regarding software engineering. I play the bass and the guitar and I make random covers in my living room when I (rarely) get the time.

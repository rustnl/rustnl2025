Trait objects are everywhere in Rust, but do you know how they actually work?
Join me as I re-invent trait objects from first principles, 
explain their inner workings, and discover all the smart design decisions behind them.

//////

A nonbinary compiler engineer.
Currently working on the rust compiler as a member of the [compiler team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#team-compiler)
(having worked on features like ""explicit tail calls"" and ""the never type"", among many other things) in my own time and on writing a proprietary rustc backend at tasking.com.
I've also maintained a popular library for chat bots ([teloxide](https://lib.rs/crates/teloxide), 3.3k github stars) and co-created the [unfair rust quiz](https://this.quiz.is.fckn.gay).

I just ""do stuff"" and in the past 4 years, ""the stuff"" is mostly Rust.

The description for this field seems to imply that I should put something silly here too, not just the dry boring facts...
I love hiking on mountains, both in Celeste (the critically acclaimed 2018 platformer) *and* in real life.

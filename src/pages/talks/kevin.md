////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

Kevin Boos is a principal software architect at Futurewei and the tech lead of Project Robius, an open-source Rust framework for developing immersive, fully-featured applications in Rust that run seamlessly across multiple platforms, including mobile. Previously, he created Theseus OS, an open-source OS written from scratch in Rust that rethinks how to maximally leverage language mechanisms for compile-time safety and verifiable correctness. Kevin obtained his PhD from Rice University with a focus on OS design, with other interests spanning the domains of I/O virtualization, device drivers, mobile VR, static analysis, and safe languages.

Unsafe fields are on track to be the first major extension to Rust's safety tooling in a decade.
This talk is a tour of the design process for unsafe fields&mdash;stretching from the feature's early ideation in 2014,
to the all-gas design and implementation sprint of the New Year, and
whatever the coming months have in store (speculatively: another lang team meeting, experimentation within the standard library and RFC review).

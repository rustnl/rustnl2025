You may have heard that floating point numbers are "numerically unstable" and "shouldn't be hashed", but why? Today we'll learn all the reasons why this is a TERRIBLE idea, and then we'll break all the rules and do it anyway! What are they going to do, put me in floating point jail?

BiExtremely average programmer, vacillating between "it's so over" and "we're so back". I write Rust for a living at the Foresight Spatial Labs, making CAD software with the Bevy engine. I love writing, making games, and folding origami! I'm also a grandmaster Tetris player.o

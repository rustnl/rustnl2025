[Rust for Linux](https://rust-for-linux.com) is the project adding
support for the Rust language to the Linux kernel.

Its growth is accelerating, both in terms of contributors and lines of
code committed into the mainline kernel -- nowadays there is a good
chance that users may happen to run Rust code in certain Linux
distributions.

This talk will give a high-level overview of the current state of the
project, including recent developments in the latest Linux releases
and updates from related projects.

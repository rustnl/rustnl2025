Rust is a language we all know and love; however, we can't yet use it on all systems. Certain architectures / platforms don't support Rust at all, only providing a C compiler. In this talk, I will show you how we can compile Rust to C, allowing us to bring the language to new places!

Hi! I am Michał Kostrubiec(aka FractalFir). I am a young(19 year old) student from Poland, obsessed with compilers and procedural generation - code is my artform. 
For the past 1.5 years, I have been working on compiling Rust for some obscure targets. I managed to get Rust running inside the .NET runtime, 
and I am now working on compiling Rust to C. This would allow us to run Rust pretty much anywhere, which is neat :).

I also am a big space nerd - I love writing gravity simulations.

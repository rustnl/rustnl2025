Creative Technologist: a hybrid engineer/artist making interactive installations, exhibitions, generative performances and more. Behind all this: hacky spaghetti code or sophisticated integration of software and hardware? Turns out, Rust might be the perfect tool for such idiosyncratic developers!

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

Stephen Buchanan studied Television Journalism and Media Studies and somehow also Computer Science. After working as a video editor and motion graphics designer for many years, he turned to event production technology and eventually full-time into web, games and interactive installation development. With a background in Java, C++ and TypeScript, his attentions have turned to Rust in the last 4 years, finding it surprisingly fitting for an industry more known for creative hacking than precision and high performance programming. Stephen is currently a senior “Creative Technologist” at Random Studio, an experience design agency based in Amsterdam and Paris.

Embedded development is long overdue for refitting, and Rust is a perfect fit. In this talk (on behalf of the Rust Embedded Working Group) I will make the case for Rust as the next dominant Embedded language, and describe the things that are happening and need to happen on the Rust side to get there.

Bart Massey has been doing embedded HW/SW since the late 1970s, including a two-year professional stint in the TV Measurement Division of Tektronix, Inc. Bart is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University, where he has taught several hundred students Rust and Embedded Rust over the last seven years. He is the founder and lead of Rust-Edu [(https://rust-edu.org)](https://rust-edu.org), an organization accelerating Rust education in academia and elsewhere. Bart is a member of the Resources Team of the Rust Embedded Working Group, where he has been working on editing the Rust Embedded Discovery Book and on the BBC MicroBit crate ecosystem. As a consultant, he has helped to train industry folks in Rust including embedded basics.

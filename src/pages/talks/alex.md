TBA

////// <!-- sepatator between abstract and bio -->

I'm a Rust team alumni who participated on a number of teams including Core, Cargo, Libs, and others. I contributed to Rust prior to it's 1.0 release in 2015 and the years afterwards. Nowadays I've shifted my focus to WebAssembly and primarily work on Wasmtime, an out-of-browser WebAssembly engine. I also help maintain the Rust and WebAssembly integration and targets.

Graviola is a new cryptography crate for Rust. It focuses on being high-quality, fast and easy to build. In this talk, I'll cover what makes it different from other cryptography crates -- and my goals for this project.

I'm Joe, hailing from Cambridge, UK. I'm a security engineer, formerly with Twilio, Electric Imp, BlackBerry, Good Technology, Thales, and nCipher. These days I mostly work in Rust, but my professional experience is in C and C++. I'm the original author of the "rustls" Rust crate, which provides TLS support to most of the Rust ecosystem.

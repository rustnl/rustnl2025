We've all heard the joke: for every five Rust games, we build fifty game engines. And honestly? No shame in that! But for those looking to tip the scales toward actually making games, I want to share my experience developing POLDERS—a historical Dutch city builder where you must fight the sea to keep your town safe.

This talk is a case study on using the Bevy engine at scale for 3D, covering procedural generation, custom shaders, and UI systems. Expect hard-won lessons and plenty of insights into making Bevy work for a full-fledged game.

Architectural designer turned geodetic engineer turned game developer. Discovered Rust five years ago and haven’t touched another language since. Currently developing POLDERS as co-owner of Geofront.nl. Passionate about connecting CAD, BIM, and GIS industries—because we have a lot to learn from each other!

When I’m not behind a keyboard, you’ll find me cycling, boxing, reading, or making music. Terrible at chess, but excellent at cheesy tarot readings.
